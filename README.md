# 'Nother Interactive Fiction Framework

NIF is a new way of creating interactive fiction games in C++, all from your command line.

## Simple and easy

All you need to know is the basics of C++ (or C, I suppose). Also, you will need the C++ compiler `g++` or `clang++`. There are simple header files to get you started with what you need.

## Getting started

You can get started by downloading all these header/c++ source files to your local game folder (or, if you wish (RECCOMENDED) move it to `/usr/local/include`.

To get started, please consult the [documentation](https://github.com/infection-tag/nif/blob/main/Documentation/getting-started.md). It's really detailed and should be enough to get you started!

## Still under development

NIF is still under development, and is nowhere close to completion. If you would like to help, please do so.
